The Gyms and Fitness Centres industry has grown strongly over the past five years while undergoing considerable structural change. According to IBIS World, the average Gyms and Fitness Centre industry growth from 2014 to 2019 was 5.7%.

The rapid growth of functional fitness-based gyms has attracted wealthy and time-poor consumers and supported industry revenue growth. However, a decline in income over the past five years has limited the industryâ€™s expansion.

This dashboard is designed to show the key performance and data of the fitness industry in Victoria and Australia, which include the the age group with highest participation rate in fitness, total revenue between 2018-2019 and the number of fitness center in Victoria state.
